round 1 : ignore complaint summary/just run simple grid search/ check for scores

round 2 : ignore complaint summary/ just run simple grid seach/figure out the roc curve issue

round 3 : ignore complaint summary/just run simple grid search/ figure out classification matrix

round 4 : ignore complaint summary/ run grid search of xgbclassifier

round 5 : ignore complaint summary/ run grid search of other classifiers such as rdge/ensemble,etc

...to do...all i can think of right now

tf-idf normalization??? -- for text classification , for text modelling

things i think i can do:

1. remove noise..keywords like the, is , a , i , you,etc. udemy course has a video on how to do this
2. check if set reduces
3. deal with apostrophes
4. may be convert to tfid, and then run cosine similarity.
5. run lda to deduce the main thing being spoken about - topic modelling
