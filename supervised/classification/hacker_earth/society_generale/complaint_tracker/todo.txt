...to do...all i can think of right now

tf-idf normalization??? -- for text classification , for text modelling

things i think i can do:(all done, divided into 25 diff topics)

1. remove noise..keywords like the, is , a , i , you,etc. udemy course has a video on how to do this
2. check if set reduces
3. deal with apostrophes
4. may be convert to tfid, and then run cosine similarity.
5. run lda to deduce the main thing being spoken about - topic modelling
