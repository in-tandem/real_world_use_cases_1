# real_world_use_cases_1
Machine learning real world use cases
compiled from competitions in kaggle and hackerearth. Data sets from udemy course/kaggle sites.
along with utility coding - mainly for self, codebases which serve as utils for ML use cases 
as well as pynbs on machine learning fundamentals which i had a hard time understanding



<b>Codebase: multiclass roc and precision recall curves</b>

https://github.com/in-tandem/real_world_use_cases_1/blob/master/utilities/multi_class_plot_utils.pyhttps://github.com/in-tandem/real_world_use_cases_1/blob/master/utilities/multi_class_plot_utils.py

★This particular piece of code would enable you to plot multi class ROC/AUC curve as well as precision recall curve.

Usage example: https://github.com/in-tandem/real_world_use_cases_1/blob/master/utilities/multi_class_roc_auc_precision.py
